I PULLED OFF THE ROAD AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN MY TACHOMETER RACED UP TO 6000 RPM'S. I WAS AT A COMPLETE STOP AND MY SPEED WAS NOW 0 BUT MY RPM'S WERE SHOWING ALMOST 5000.     AFTER TURNING OFF MY IGNITION FOR A FEW MINUTES, THE SPEEDOMETER STARTED WORKING AGAIN BUT IT WAS VERY JUMPY. THE TACH IS NOW READING 3500 WHEN THE IGNITION IS TURNED OFF.    THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE TREATED AS SUCH BY GM AND CHEVROLET. I'VE LITERALLY READ OVER 400 ONLINE POSTINGS IN THE LAST HOUR FROM PEOPLE EXPERIENCING SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER ON GM AND CHEVROLET TRUCKS AND SPORT UTILITIES.  *JB", "cmpl_type": "NHTSA WEB SITE", "police_rpt_yn": "N", "purch_dt": "2005-04-21", "orig_owner_yn": "N", "anti_brakes_yn": "Y", "cruise_cont_yn": "Y", "num_cyls": "8", "drive_train": "RWD", "fuel_sys": "FI", "fuel_type": "GAS", "trans_type": "AUTO", "veh_speed": "65", "prod_type": "VEHICLE"}}
