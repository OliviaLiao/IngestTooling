THIS EXPLORER ONLY HAS 49,000 MILES ON IT. MY WIFE DRIVES THIS CAR AND I KNOW IT HAS NEVER BEEN BEAT ON. I STILL DO NOT HAVE MY TRUCK BACK YET IT HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP FOR ABOUT 4 DAYS NOW. I AM ABOUT UP TO 1200 DOLLARS IN REPAIRS. I HAVE READ SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SAME THING ON THE INTERNET. I JUAST CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DON'T HAVE A RECALL.    *JB", "cmpl_type": "NHTSA WEB SITE", "police_rpt_yn": "N", "purch_dt": "2003-07-27", "orig_owner_yn": "Y", "anti_brakes_yn": "Y", "cruise_cont_yn": "Y", "num_cyls": "6", "drive_train": "4WD", "fuel_sys": "FI", "fuel_type": "GAS", "trans_type": "AUTO", "veh_speed": "5", "prod_type": "VEHICLE"}}
