I HAD THEM JUMP START IT AND THE AIRBAG DUMMY LIGHT CAME ON AS SOON AS THE CAR STARTED. IT BEEPED AND SAID AIRBAG FAULT ON THE DASH. THEN THE TURN SIGNAL SYSTEM STARTED TO SIMULATE THE SOUND OF THE TURN SIGNAL AS IF IT WAS ON. FIRST IT WAS AFTER I COMPLETED THE TURN IT WOULD STAY ON AND SPEED UP OR SLOW DOWN THE CLICKING NOISE. WITHIN A MONTH IT STARTED DOING IT WHILE I WAS DRIVING STRAIGHT DOWN THE ROAD. I AM UNSURE IF THE TURN SIGNAL SYSTEM IS WORKING PROPERLY. SOMETIMES THE FLASHERS DON'T SEEM WORK AT RANDOM AS FAR AS I CAN TELL FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT. I HAD A DEALER RESET THE AIRBAG FAULT BUT THEY SAID THAT THEY \"THINK\" THAT WE NEED TO REPLACE THE MULTI-FUNCTION SWITCH ON THE SIDE OF THE STEERING COLUMN. I'M NOT ABOUT TO SPEND 500 DOLLARS ON SOMETHING THAT THE DEALER ISN'T EVEN SURE OF THEMSELVES.   *JB", "cmpl_type": "NHTSA WEB SITE", "police_rpt_yn": "N", "purch_dt": "2006-04-29", "orig_owner_yn": "N", "anti_brakes_yn": "Y", "cruise_cont_yn": "Y", "num_cyls": "6", "drive_train": "FWD", "fuel_sys": "FI", "fuel_type": "GAS", "trans_type": "MAN", "veh_speed": "0", "prod_type": "VEHICLE"}}
