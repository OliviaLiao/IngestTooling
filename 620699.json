IT IS A 2000 WITH 58,000 MILES. THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT AND LEXUS REFUSES TO FIX IT UNDER WARRANTY (CLAIMING ITS 6 YEAR OR 70,000 MILES). NOW THAT I AM DOING RESEARCH, IT APPEARS THAT THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THE RX300. IT APPEARS THEY HAVE FAULTY TRANSMISSIONS. I AM HOPING YOU CAN HELP. THE FORUMS SEEM TO INDICATE THAT IF WE FILE REPORTS, HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE A RECALL OR SOME SORT OF LEGAL CLAIM. THE LEXUS OF SANTA MONICA WANT TO CHARGE ME $4,800, THEY OFFERED A 10% DISCOUNT. *JB", "cmpl_type": "NHTSA WEB SITE", "police_rpt_yn": "N", "purch_dt": "2006-10-16", "orig_owner_yn": "N", "anti_brakes_yn": "N", "cruise_cont_yn": "Y", "num_cyls": "6", "drive_train": "FWD", "fuel_sys": "FI", "fuel_type": "GAS", "trans_type": "AUTO", "prod_type": "VEHICLE"}}
